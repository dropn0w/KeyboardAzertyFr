= French AZERTY Keyboard Library for Arduino =

*** UPDATE => In their previous version, when you need to import the library keyboard.h (french version) and execute the payload on Arduino, an error occurs with the Keyboard.cpp file. 
They forgot to add something in one line, I corrected it. Everything is functionnal now.

You can just copy those files and paste them on your arduino/libraries/Keyboard file.


This library allows an Arduino board with USB capabilites to act as a french AZERTY Keyboard.

For more information about the original Keyboard library please visit
https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/usb/keyboard/

== limitations ==

This library does not allow a perfect emulation a french AZERTY keyboard, but can be used for ascii characters (see src/KeyBoardAzertyFr.cpp).

== How to use ==

This library should be used like the original Keyboard Library. Simply use KeyboardAzertyFr instead of Keyboard (i.e. KeyboardAzertyFr.write('a') instead of Keyboard.write('a')).
